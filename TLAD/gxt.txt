	E1CC_CM02_41 = ~z~Is that, is that how you start, 'cause it -
	E1CC_CM02_42 = ~z~I mean you'd be frightened that they said no
	E1CC_CM02_43 = ~z~but you'd be a lot more frightened that they said yes!
	E1CC_CM02_44 = ~z~"Yes, why not! Get the sandwich maker and the lava lamp out.
	E1CC_CM02_45 = ~z~Let's make a fucking night of it!"
	E1CC_CM02_46 = ~z~I've got children now, I've got a wee boy - he's eleven months.
	E1CC_CM02_47 = ~z~Starting to get a bit fucking sick of him to be honest.
	E1CC_CM02_48 = ~z~I've got a wee girl as well, she's four.
	E1CC_CM02_49 = ~z~And you know what no one tells you?
	E1CC_CM02_50 = ~z~Kids are a fantastic way of meeting women.
	E1CC_CM02_51 = ~z~They're a real conversation starter.
	E1CC_CM02_52 = ~z~Especially if you get them little cute tops that say "Future DJ", that kind of thing.
	E1CC_CM02_53 = ~z~So my daughter's four, I've got her a lovely little pink top that says
	E1CC_CM02_54 = ~z~"My mummy's dead.
	E1CC_CM02_55 = ~z~But daddy's single!"
	E1CC_CM02_56 = ~z~The other thing with kids,
	E1CC_CM02_57 = ~z~is that sometimes you're just in that kid mode and you don't even have them with you.
	E1CC_CM02_58 = ~z~And you'll just say things that have never been said in human history.
	E1CC_CM02_59 = ~z~I went to the supermarket a couple of weeks ago.
	E1CC_CM02_60 = ~z~I didn't have the kids with me, but I was in that mode,
	E1CC_CM02_61 = ~z~and I picked up the cheese and I went "Hello, Mr. Cheese!"
	E1CC_CM02_62 = ~z~And this guy beside me got really angry!
	E1CC_CM02_63 = ~z~Cause he thought I was talking to him.
	E1CC_CM02_64 = ~z~And I had to turn to this guy and go,
	E1CC_CM02_65 = ~z~"I wasn't talking to you, mate - I was talking to the cheese".
	E1CC_CM02_66 = ~z~I was having breakfast with my daughter a couple of weeks ago,
	E1CC_CM02_67 = ~z~and she goes "Daddy, what's the best thing in the world?"
	E1CC_CM02_68 = ~z~So I didn't even have to think about it, right, I said
	E1CC_CM02_69 = ~z~"Darling, you're the best thing in the world.
	E1CC_CM02_70 = ~z~I don't even have to think about it. It's definitely you".
	E1CC_CM02_71 = ~z~And she sat there for a bit, and then she went
	E1CC_CM02_72 = ~z~"For me it's sausages".
	E1CC_CM02_73 = ~z~Hey, a pleasure talking to you motherfuckers!
	E1CC_CM03_1 = ~z~Split Sides Comedy Club welcomes, Frankie Boyle!
	E1CC_CM03_2 = ~z~Hello!
	E1CC_CM03_3 = ~z~Hey, shut it pal.
	E1CC_CM03_4 = ~z~You'll leave here with an asshole like a yawning hippo's mouth.
	E1CC_CM03_5 = ~z~I'm quite a grumpy bastard.
	E1CC_CM03_6 = ~z~I drink, er, that Electrolyte drink to do the shows.
	E1CC_CM03_7 = ~z~It's good that they've finally managed to can anxiety, isn't it?
	E1CC_CM03_8 = ~z~It's good that there's a drink that gives me the resting heart rate
	E1CC_CM03_9 = ~z~of a serial killer ejaculating into a school sock.
	E1CC_CM03_10 = ~z~I don't drink.
	E1CC_CM03_11 = ~z~My best mate gave up the same time as me
	E1CC_CM03_12 = ~z~and he said it was because he could never imagine anything worse
	E1CC_CM03_13 = ~z~than waking up in the morning with less money than you thought you had
	E1CC_CM03_14 = ~z~and a really sore head.
	E1CC_CM03_15 = ~z~I said, "It could be worse;
	E1CC_CM03_16 = ~z~you could wake up with much more money than you thought you had.
	E1CC_CM03_17 = ~z~And a really sore arse."
	E1CC_CM03_18 = ~z~When I was at school, I could never work out how to get girls' bras undone.
	E1CC_CM03_19 = ~z~I just couldn't do it.
	E1CC_CM03_20 = ~z~And then eventually I realized that these girls were wearing a different type of bra...
	E1CC_CM03_21 = ~z~from my Gran.
	E1CC_CM03_22 = ~z~If you don't like that, you're going to fucking hate this next bit.
	E1CC_CM03_23 = ~z~The oldest woman ever to give birth gave birth this year.
	E1CC_CM03_24 = ~z~She was 70.
	E1CC_CM03_25 = ~z~I imagine at 70, the baby didn't have to force its way out.
	E1CC_CM03_26 = ~z~It spent the last three months bungee jumping.
	E1CC_CM03_27 = ~z~Every time she went for a shit, it had to brace itself.
	E1CC_CM03_28 = ~z~Can you imagine what having a baby must have done
	E1CC_CM03_29 = ~z~to the state of a 70-year-old's fanny?
	E1CC_CM03_30 = ~z~Absolutely nothing at all.
	E1CC_CM03_31 = ~z~No, I'm sure it was actually a magical moment.
	E1CC_CM03_32 = ~z~I'd love to have been there when her dust broke.
	E1CC_CM03_33 = ~z~I love old people, I do,
	E1CC_CM03_34 = ~z~but I hate it when they're always boasting about what they did in the war.
	E1CC_CM03_35 = ~z~Come on, Grandad, we're trying to have Christmas dinner here.
	E1CC_CM03_36 = ~z~Nobody gives a fuck how many Jews you killed.
	E1CC_CM03_37 = ~z~I suppose the only thing I don't like about old people is that,
	E1CC_CM03_38 = ~z~when you have anal sex with them, there's almost no grip.
	E1CC_CM03_39 = ~z~You'd get more purchase fucking their open grave.
	E1CC_CM03_40 = ~z~I'm trying to think if I've got any cheerful jokes at all.
	E1CC_CM03_41 = ~z~Oh yes! As a man, never get a Brazilian.
	E1CC_CM03_42 = ~z~Because, when you get a hard-on, you look like a sundial at noon.
	E1CC_CM03_43 = ~z~You know my favorite time of year? Halloween.
	E1CC_CM03_44 = ~z~Halloween, a wonderful time of year for the agoraphobic pedophile.
	E1CC_CM03_45 = ~z~They're being delivered to the door, in little costumes?
	E1CC_CM03_46 = ~z~How many dead hookers can you fit in a garage?
	E1CC_CM03_47 = ~z~Another two, if I move my bike.
	E1CC_CM03_48 = ~z~See, I think a lot of this stuff with offensiveness in comedy comes from the fact
	E1CC_CM03_49 = ~z~that we're often talking about big stereotypes and generalizations.
	E1CC_CM03_50 = ~z~And they're not always true, are they?
	E1CC_CM03_51 = ~z~So, for example, I've got a friend does a routine about,
	E1CC_CM03_52 = ~z~"Oh, don't you hate it when your partner comes to bed and they're cold,
	E1CC_CM03_53 = ~z~and they try to get heat off you?"
	E1CC_CM03_54 = ~z~And I always think, well, what if you're a necrophiliac?
	E1CC_CM03_55 = ~z~Maybe you love it when they're cold?
	E1CC_CM03_56 = ~z~"Oh, that's brilliant, you're freezing.
	E1CC_CM03_57 = ~z~Don't move a fucking muscle.
	E1CC_CM03_58 = ~z~I want it to be realistic -
	E1CC_CM03_59 = ~z~I'm gonna open your arse cheeks with a car jack."
	E1CC_CM03_60 = ~z~See, political correctness has changed everything, hasn't it?
	E1CC_CM03_61 = ~z~I mean, people forget that even political correctness itself
	E1CC_CM03_62 = ~z~used to be called spastic gay talk.
	E1CC_CM03_63 = ~z~Apparently, at Christmas now we're not supposed to say fairy lights anymore
	E1CC_CM03_64 = ~z~because it might be homophobic.
	E1CC_CM03_65 = ~z~Apparently, now we've got to call them poof lanterns.
	E1CC_CM03_66 = ~z~Hey, it's been a pleasure.
	E1CC_CM03_67 = ~z~Stay black!
	E1CC_CM04_1 = ~z~All the way from Glasgow, Frankie Boyle!
	E1CC_CM04_2 = ~z~Hello!
	E1CC_CM04_3 = ~z~Hey, is this your woman, pal?
	E1CC_CM04_4 = ~z~She looks like she could rip you apart like a fucking chicken wing.
	E1CC_CM04_5 = ~z~Does he touch the sides?
	E1CC_CM04_6 = ~z~When he does, do you vibrate and your nose lights up?
	E1CC_CM04_7 = ~z~Read this great thing recently,
	E1CC_CM04_8 = ~z~said that scientists are going to start treating alcoholism with LSD.
	E1CC_CM04_9 = ~z~That's going to make tramps very different people.
	E1CC_CM04_10 = ~z~Any spare change, pal? I've got a unicorn to feed.
	E1CC_CM04_11 = ~z~Apparently, scientists have come up with a condom for premature ejaculation.
	E1CC_CM04_12 = ~z~And, basically, it's got an anesthetic in the lining and it makes you numb
	E1CC_CM04_13 = ~z~and you can last for longer.
	E1CC_CM04_14 = ~z~Or, you can wear it inside out,
	E1CC_CM04_15 = ~z~and you don't have to wake anybody up.
	E1CC_CM04_16 = ~z~Mollis is overrated, isn't it?
	E1CC_CM04_17 = ~z~Mollis actually takes half an hour to have any effect.
	E1CC_CM04_18 = ~z~I often find that, in that time,
	E1CC_CM04_19 = ~z~the woman has managed to wriggle free.
	E1CC_CM04_20 = ~z~You ever heard that science thing that the human female
	E1CC_CM04_21 = ~z~has exactly the same pheromone scent as an orangutan female?
	E1CC_CM04_22 = ~z~It was news to me.
	E1CC_CM04_23 = ~z~I'll never wear a blindfold again.
	E1CC_CM04_24 = ~z~They told me she was European.
	E1CC_CM04_25 = ~z~You ever heard that science thing that,
	E1CC_CM04_26 = ~z~if you put a frog into boiling water it'll jump out,
	E1CC_CM04_27 = ~z~but, if you put it into cold water and you heat the water up,
	E1CC_CM04_28 = ~z~the frog won't realize and it'll die?
	E1CC_CM04_29 = ~z~Or, to put it another way, scientists have got a lot of fucking time on their hands.
	E1CC_CM04_30 = ~z~"Shall we have a go at curing cancer? "
	E1CC_CM04_31 = ~z~"No, I'm going to see how many fruit pastilles it takes to choke a kestrel. "
	E1CC_CM04_32 = ~z~Do you know what I hate?
	E1CC_CM04_33 = ~z~Charity. Charity doesn't work, right?
	E1CC_CM04_34 = ~z~Because we want it to work won't make it fucking work.
	E1CC_CM04_35 = ~z~You might want to send money to people in Africa.
	E1CC_CM04_36 = ~z~That money takes no account of cultural difference.
	E1CC_CM04_37 = ~z~It takes no account of the reality of those people's lives.
	E1CC_CM04_38 = ~z~If you give a man a fish, he'll eat for a day.
	E1CC_CM04_39 = ~z~If you give him a fishing rod, he'll break it up for firewood.
	E1CC_CM04_40 = ~z~Or maybe swap it for a fish.
	E1CC_CM04_41 = ~z~I hate that fat fuck, John Hunter.
	E1CC_CM04_42 = ~z~You're talking about a guy who's so fat
	E1CC_CM04_43 = ~z~he can't wear a belt and a tie on the same day
	E1CC_CM04_44 = ~z~or he'll turn into sausages.
	E1CC_CM04_45 = ~z~I hate property programs.
	E1CC_CM04_46 = ~z~I saw one the other day, right.
	E1CC_CM04_47 = ~z~It said - if someone's coming round to view the house,
	E1CC_CM04_48 = ~z~remember to open your curtains and tidy up.
	E1CC_CM04_49 = ~z~Oh, thanks for that.
	E1CC_CM04_50 = ~z~I'd been planning on redecorating using diarrhea pills and stencils.
	E1CC_CM04_51 = ~z~Then shaving the word 'Welcome' into my fucking dog's back.
	E1CC_CM04_52 = ~z~That's a joke, I don't have a dog, obviously.
	E1CC_CM04_53 = ~z~Having pets is fucking tragic.
	E1CC_CM04_54 = ~z~Having a pet is basically saying,
	E1CC_CM04_55 = ~z~"I have tried to find love among my own species and I have failed.
	E1CC_CM04_56 = ~z~I've had to fall back on the less judgmental animal kingdom."
	E1CC_CM04_57 = ~z~Is there anything sadder than seeing someone with a dog picking up dog shit?
	E1CC_CM04_58 = ~z~I suppose, maybe someone without a dog?
	E1CC_CM04_59 = ~z~Vet - that's a job I'd like to have.
	E1CC_CM04_60 = ~z~I don't know how long I could be a vet
	E1CC_CM04_61 = ~z~before I got bored and started fucking stuff.
	E1CC_CM04_62 = ~z~I'd fuck an owl,
	E1CC_CM04_63 = ~z~because it could give you eye contact whatever position you took it in.
	E1CC_CM04_64 = ~z~Or fuck a kitten.
	E1CC_CM04_65 = ~z~Imagine having sex with something you actually wanted to cuddle afterwards?
	E1CC_CM04_66 = ~z~Hey, have a great weekend!

In an exclusive interview, Betania told the Liberty Tree, "He hasn't decorated my interior since the wedding night, I'll admit, but I know what my husband is and isn't. I'd never dream of going shopping for clothes without him. Nobody understands layering like Dalton. Can't a man wear fuchsia and depilate these days without being called gay?" Randolph, who says that he is waging a one-man war against terracotta, is best-known for jumping up and down and clapping while squealing, "What is this hot mess?" when he walks into somebody's house for the first time.

Human resource professionals at all the firms were humiliated to discover they had employed as up to 65 per cent of their work force people who are not morally destitute and greedy as can be. One CEO commented to us "How are we supposed to make our growth targets and raise our share price if we are not taking undue risks with other people's money, driven on by the desperate greed of our brokers?

Rosenburg's attorney told Weazel News that his client now regularly devours a stuffed Pollo Toto Frito, a jar of mayonnaise, three pizzas and a plate of chocolate brownies covered in ranch sauce. He's lost his wallet seventeen times in the last month, developed an obsession with iconic bands of the 1970s and has started expressing increasingly left-wing political views.

Sue them till they get a clue that work is about more than working.

	0x0CC29217 = Race a disgrace
	0x1C7C11D4 = The Governor's election is heating up and so are the blow-hard liberals who want to take an innocent incident and blow it out of proportion. John Hunter has stood up for all races, not just white people. If elected Governor he has promised to reach out to minorities by increasing welfare payments. And this is the thanks he gets? What John Hunter says in the privacy of his home, or in this case, out the window of his car at a gentleman of color holding up traffic, is just that - private. Let's stick to the issues in this election like keeping gays from marrying. Your filthy sex makes God angry.

	0x11D2352C = As horrible as recent events in the Alderney State Correctional Facility have been, there are reasons to be grateful for it. The secular morons will now stop their whining and we'll be able to bring in the two things that might help our prisons - corporal punishment and prayer. These men don't deserve human rights. They lost their rights when they ran that red light or sold that dime bad of weed to a teenager. We need to beat 'em and make 'em atone for their evils. There's nothing in this world that can't be corrected by a little prayer and a beating or two (a day) - my son is the prefect example. A strict course of flagellation and prayer sessions cured him of his homosexuality. Now he lives a happy and totally straight life in Westminster with his hairdresser roommate.

	0xDD96794F = We all know that liberals love drugs. From Vinewood cocaine parties to ecstasy-fueled swinging suburban romps, to pre-schoolers having their drinks laced with acid and college kids shooting up heroin, nothing says 'liberal drop out' like a family ruined by the ravages of drugs. Now, police are saying there is an incontrovertible link between drugs coming into our city and our nation and the terror threat we all face. It's the thing liberals love most - the fact that their licentious behavior is putting the lives of all of us at deadly risk.
	0xEB6594ED = Why? Because terrorists sell drugs to liberals to buy bombs to kill us all. It's really that simple. The police department said so yesterday and I for one believe them. Now that we finally have the truth, it isn't the military industrial complex that's the problem, so isn't it time that we punish drug addicts properly like the criminals they really are?

And so were all the children who watched this gender-bending freak fest. Thankfully, CNT confirmed today that Hermaphrodite Island will not be returning for a second season. This circus side show was a prime example of the depths to which television has sunk. In the old days, babies with manginas were taken quietly outside and thrown down the well. Well, times have changed. We know that these 'people' can't help the fact that they were born to sin. But what kind of message does it send out when we parade them in front of our kids at 7pm on a Saturday night? Is it any wonder that degenerate behavior continues to thrive among the youth of today? Shemales and ladyboys cavorting around in their underwear. This isn't Thailand. The producers should be ashamed of themselves.

The death of Evan Moss, amateur body builder, drug addict and cum receptacle for "Gay" Tony Prince, got himself killed in the most brutal of fashions. This just goes to show that a deviant lifestyle will lead to an unfashionably early arrival at the sodomites' party in Hell. Deputy Mayor, Bryce Dawkins, weighed in on the issue "If America is to remain the moral Christian country I know it is, we need to take the vote away from these people. They can concentrate on picking out wallpaper and leave the choosing of our President to real men."

Boss used strong language about your lack of passion on a project but unlimited time and creativity for your personal blog? Sue. The mainstream media is to blame, which we are not by any means the mainstream media, despite the fact that we have a TV station in every city with at least one stoplight and are on every cable box in America. We're outsiders, we're angry, and these lazy twenty-somethings want to live on the dole of mommy or America and we're not having it. We prefer to be on the dole of corporate tax breaks and subsidies. Sandra McColland , you can sue all you want. If you don't love America and you are too tired from reading your communist pamphlets, die. Please.
