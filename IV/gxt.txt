	GERV3_STRIP_10 = ~z~~x~I actually had to have a medical... uh, for this tour,
	GERV3_STRIP_11 = ~z~~x~and I've had medicals before for TV work,
	GERV3_STRIP_12 = ~z~~x~and they just check your pulse, and go, "You're fine".
	GERV3_STRIP_13 = ~z~~x~But I went along to the doctor, and he said, uh...
	GERV3_STRIP_14 = ~z~~x~"Oh, it's a bit more thorough than usual, you know, it's a big tour.
	GERV3_STRIP_15 = ~z~~x~We need a urine sample."
	GERV3_STRIP_16 = ~z~~x~I've never had to do that before, so ah...
	GERV3_STRIP_17 = ~z~~x~you know, I went to the toilet, filled up this little bottle he gave me, good as gold.
	GERV3_STRIP_18 = ~z~~x~Gave it back to him. He went, "Oh, can you strip down to your boxer shorts?".
	GERV3_STRIP_19 = ~z~~x~I thought, "This is thorough."
	GERV3_STRIP_20 = ~z~~x~So I stripped down to my boxer shorts,
	GERV3_STRIP_21 = ~z~~x~"Ah for fuu..."
	GERV3_STRIP_22 = ~z~~x~The one day I wear white boxer shorts...
	GERV3_STRIP_23 = ~z~~x~big wet patch from the wee.
	GERV3_STRIP_24 = ~z~~x~Well, why didn't he warn me?
	GERV3_STRIP_25 = ~z~~x~Why didn't he say, "Be careful, I'll be checkin' for stains in a minute." Do you know what I...
	GERV3_STRIP_26 = ~z~~x~So embarrassing, there's nothing I could do.
	GERV3_STRIP_27 = ~z~~x~I told my friend, and my friend went:
	GERV3_STRIP_28 = ~z~~x~"You should have gone commando!"
	GERV3_STRIP_29 = ~z~~x~Well, that would have been less embarrassing, wouldn't it?
	GERV3_STRIP_30 = ~z~~x~So, now I strip down to my boxer shorts, and I go, "Oh God, I've wet myself, what can I do?
	GERV3_STRIP_31 = ~z~~x~I know!"
	GERV3_STRIP_32 = ~z~~x~Go commando...
	GERV3_STRIP_33 = ~z~~x~do commandos not wear pants?
	GERV3_STRIP_34 = ~z~~x~Why is it called goin' comm....? They must wear pants...
	GERV3_STRIP_35 = ~z~~x~I dunno, any commandos in... do you wear...?
	GERV3_STRIP_36 = ~z~~x~"Why you...
	GERV3_STRIP_37 = ~z~~x~ Why you not wearing pants?"
	GERV3_STRIP_38 = ~z~~x~"What do you mean, cuz' we're commandos? They...
	GERV3_STRIP_39 = ~z~~x~They're gonna see that, at least camouflage it!"

	GERV3_STRIP_43 = ~z~~x~But I am a bit overweight...
	GERV3_STRIP_44 = ~z~~x~I never worried about that before I was famous. And I'm not more vain now,
	GERV3_STRIP_45 = ~z~~x~it's that, you read about yourself...
	GERV3_STRIP_46 = ~z~~x~and the papers, they need an adjective.
	GERV3_STRIP_47 = ~z~~x~They can't just say, "Ricky Gervais, Comedian".
	GERV3_STRIP_48 = ~z~~x~They say things like, "Ricky Gervais, Tubby Comedian".

	GERV4_AIDS_4 = ~z~~x~Calm down.
	GERV4_AIDS_5 = ~z~~x~I do a lot of work for charity.
	GERV4_AIDS_6 = ~z~~x~I don't do enough; they say you can always do more.
	GERV4_AIDS_7 = ~z~~x~But I look at it like this,
	GERV4_AIDS_8 = ~z~~x~it's a pain, ain't it?
	GERV4_AIDS_9 = ~z~~x~Nothing in it for me.
	GERV4_AIDS_10 = ~z~~x~Do a lot of work for, um, cancer.
	GERV4_AIDS_11 = ~z~~x~That's my chosen charity.
	GERV4_AIDS_12 = ~z~~x~Do a lot of work for people with cancer.
	GERV4_AIDS_13 = ~z~~x~And they're welcome to it.
	GERV4_AIDS_14 = ~z~~x~But I will say this, if I ever get cancer myself,
	GERV4_AIDS_15 = ~z~~x~I'm going to walk into the nearest hospital and go right; I paid for that machine,
	GERV4_AIDS_16 = ~z~~x~get that little bald fucker off it.
	GERV4_AIDS_17 = ~z~~x~Talking of um, little bald fuckers, I did the teenage cancer gig last year. What?
	GERV4_AIDS_18 = ~z~~x~No I done it, two years before, but they called again last year.
	GERV4_AIDS_19 = ~z~~x~"We're still ill...".
	GERV4_AIDS_20 = ~z~~x~You lasted.
	GERV4_AIDS_21 = ~z~~x~It's a great gig though, the kids with cancer get in for free, and you meet them afterwards, and...
	GERV4_AIDS_22 = ~z~~x~you know, they come backstage and you sign stuff for them, and...
	GERV4_AIDS_23 = ~z~~x~I was doing the gig, this last year, and I looked down and I recognized one of them.
	GERV4_AIDS_24 = ~z~~x~And I thought, oh yeah, he came back stage two years ago.
	GERV4_AIDS_25 = ~z~~x~He was telling me about his illness and he said he was eighteen.
	GERV4_AIDS_26 = ~z~~x~And that was then, that was two years ago, so now he must be twenty -
	GERV4_AIDS_27 = ~z~~x~so how the fuck is he still a teenager?
	GERV4_AIDS_28 = ~z~~x~And I was doing the gig, and he was laughing along, and I was thinking,
	GERV4_AIDS_29 = ~z~~x~"Yeah, you laugh it up mate", I was fuming.
	GERV4_AIDS_30 = ~z~~x~And eventually it got too much for me.
	GERV4_AIDS_31 = ~z~~x~And I went, "Alright mate, I recognize you... ".
	GERV4_AIDS_32 = ~z~~x~I went, "'ello, yeah, you came backstage two years ago?".
	GERV4_AIDS_33 = ~z~~x~He went "Yeah",
	GERV4_AIDS_34 = ~z~~x~I said "You said you were eighteen then?", he went "Yeah... ", "So you're twenty now?".
	GERV4_AIDS_35 = ~z~~x~He went "Yeah". I said, "Get out!".
	GERV4_AIDS_36 = ~z~~x~And I called security.
	GERV4_AIDS_37 = ~z~~x~And they came, and he struggled, but he was weak.
	GERV4_AIDS_38 = ~z~~x~I mean, I think they worked out, 'cause they...
	GERV4_AIDS_39 = ~z~~x~although they had trouble getting hold of him to start with, d'you know...?
	GERV4_AIDS_40 = ~z~~x~but eventually they... his drip nearly had someone's eye out.
	GERV4_AIDS_41 = ~z~~x~The crowd started booing, I went "Hear that?
	GERV4_AIDS_42 = ~z~~x~They don't want to see someone like you take the piss out of me."
	GERV4_AIDS_43 = ~z~~x~No money.
	GERV4_AIDS_44 = ~z~~x~I do a lot of work for AIDS as well.
	GERV4_AIDS_45 = ~z~~x~I've worked for AIDS charities for many years, from...
	GERV4_AIDS_46 = ~z~~x~the mid- to late-eighties. And back then people,
	GERV4_AIDS_47 = ~z~~x~they didn't know what this new disease, what's this new disease called AIDS?
	GERV4_AIDS_48 = ~z~~x~I mean it's gone from strength to strength now hasn't it?
	GERV4_AIDS_49 = ~z~~x~It's gone global, it's doing very well.
	GERV4_AIDS_50 = ~z~~x~Got its own day and everything.
	GERV4_AIDS_51 = ~z~~x~World AIDS day. First of December.
	GERV4_AIDS_52 = ~z~~x~I don't think it'll ever take off like Christmas.
	GERV4_AIDS_53 = ~z~~x~We don't do anything in our house. No decorations.
	GERV4_AIDS_54 = ~z~~x~You can't even get a card...
	GERV4_AIDS_55 = ~z~~x~They don't do "Sorry You Got AIDS" cards. They don't exist.
	GERV4_AIDS_56 = ~z~~x~Ahh, fascinating fact about AIDS - people always learn stuff from my lectures, this is absolutely true.
	GERV4_AIDS_57 = ~z~~x~The HIV virus was actually a combination of two separate viruses in rhesus monkeys.
	GERV4_AIDS_58 = ~z~~x~And it formed a, a rudimentary form of AIDS.
	GERV4_AIDS_59 = ~z~~x~And ah, this was passed to chimpanzees.
	GERV4_AIDS_60 = ~z~~x~Sometimes chimps would get a bloodlust, and they'll eat a rhesus monkey.
	GERV4_AIDS_61 = ~z~~x~And it sort of mutated and evolved in chimpanzees.
	GERV4_AIDS_62 = ~z~~x~And because we're ninety-eight point six percent genetically identical to chimpanzees,
	GERV4_AIDS_63 = ~z~~x~it was able to be passed to humans.
	GERV4_AIDS_64 = ~z~~x~And the first human contracted AIDS when he was chopping up chimp meat and cut his finger.
	GERV4_AIDS_65 = ~z~~x~Although that's the excuse I'd've given.
	GERV4_AIDS_66 = ~z~~x~You'd have to come up with something wouldn't you?
	GERV4_AIDS_67 = ~z~~x~Doctor goes, "Well, you're the first human to contract AIDS".
	GERV4_AIDS_68 = ~z~~x~And you go, "Is that bad?",
	GERV4_AIDS_69 = ~z~~x~"Yeah, it can be", "Well, how would I've got that?"
	GERV4_AIDS_70 = ~z~~x~"Two ways: one -
	GERV4_AIDS_71 = ~z~~x~you were fucking a chimp up the arse... ".
	GERV4_AIDS_72 = ~z~~x~"Fucking a chimp up the arse? No...
	GERV4_AIDS_73 = ~z~~x~No way.
	GERV4_AIDS_74 = ~z~~x~What's the other way I could have got it?"
	GERV4_AIDS_75 = ~z~~x~"Ah, well I suppose you could have been chopping up a chimp and cut your finger?"
	GERV4_AIDS_76 = ~z~~x~"That one."
	GERV4_AIDS_77 = ~z~~x~I bet he went straight out to the jungle and found that chimp, and went,
	GERV4_AIDS_78 = ~z~~x~"Oi! You fucking gave me AIDS!"
	GERV4_AIDS_79 = ~z~~x~"I gave you what?"
	GERV4_AIDS_80 = ~z~~x~"You gave me AIDS"
	GERV4_AIDS_81 = ~z~~x~"I gave you a blowjob". "Shush!
	GERV4_AIDS_82 = ~z~~x~No, I got AIDS from you!"
	GERV4_AIDS_83 = ~z~~x~"Well how did I get AIDS?"
	GERV4_AIDS_84 = ~z~~x~"From eating monkeys."
	GERV4_AIDS_85 = ~z~~x~"I don't eat monkeys!"
	GERV4_AIDS_86 = ~z~~x~"You were either eatin' 'em or fucking 'em."
	GERV4_AIDS_87 = ~z~~x~"I was eating them. Tastes like chicken."
	GERV4_AIDS_88 = ~z~~x~That's how it happened. Thanks very much, good night.

{
	0x093F06C3 = That's where private education and an apartment in Monaco gets you! Turns out this guy was from Eastern Europe! An immigrant! His name was something like Nino or Nico or Nonso. He could hardly speak English, had a face like a construction worker and his dress sense was simply GHASTLY! I bet he hasn't got a peseta, or whatever money they've got where he's from, to his name. I just hope that nobody on the scene saw me with him. And imagine introducing him to Daddy?! He's already threatened to cut off my credit cards. Could not bear to even think of that. All in all, it was the most painful date of my life. And when you've woken up on a beach with a professional wrestler in every orifice, that's saying something.
	0x0B0C3415 = I was so glad that I had my hand sanitizer with me. I shudder to think how many criminals have had their fingers in those sweaty holes. My hands haven't smelt so bad since my fateful night in the restroom of the Libertonian Museum with that state senator. You live and learn. Never give a 65-year-old man a prostate massage when he has food poisoning. I sat next to his wife at the Didier Sachs show in San Fierro last month. It's a powerful feeling to know that you an have any man you want. Toodle pip. Alex xxxxxx
	0x1B22E673 = Why do I keep dating these losers on craplist? My psychiatrist tells me it's because I'm a bipolar nymphomaniac who craves the approval of men in order to mask my deep-seated insecurity and self-loathing. He also tells me to keep my boots on when he's taking me from behind so I don't pay him much attention. Niko took me on a date to play pool today and I nearly died. I gave him a chance to impress me and he blew it. Big time. I haven't been that far out of my comfort zone since my foray into goatse last year. Love ya, girls xxxxx
	0x2DE50BF7 = Thought of the day. Is it worth marrying a man you hate if he has a penthouse apartment? I think so. Let's break it down. I spend an average of 17 hours a day awake (depending on levels of cocaine use) and it takes me about 10 minutes to give the type of slobbering, pornstar blowjob that men equate with true love. That is less than 1% of my day. Not bad for a girl who skipped math class to give herself a Brazilian wax with a ruler and a cigarette lighter!
	0x3A882357 = My hand towels cost more than that! It feels like I've been looking for the right mole FOREVER. Once I get my new labia next month, I think that we're done with the surgery for another year! xxxxx
	0x3DE47239 = Toodles for now xxxxxxxxxxxx
	0x5B891573 = I told Heidi about it and she is refusing to speak to me. What is it about this uncivilized brute that keeps drawing me in? Why do I always go for the wrong guys? I think that it is so important to end the day with a question and start the day with an answer... or a rail and a dirty martini.
	0x5E68CC91 = OMG!!!!!!!!!! I can't believe I forgot to tell you about my latest sexploits with Niko! The past couple of days have been such a blur! You're not going to believe this but I just had to steam-clean my whole apartment... AGAIN!!! The kitchen looked like a bomb had hit it and my chaise longue was covered in peanut butter! At least, I hope it was peanut butter.
	0x6C9768EE = Those Europeans are so kinky! Heidi told me that there is a whole village in Spain of men married to wild boars. I think he was spanking me with a frying pan at one point and the French baguette I bought on the way back from capoeira is pretty much ruined. Not that I was ever going to eat it. My vagina tightening workshop is definitely paying dividends, btw. It's like a weightlifter's fist down there! Toodles! xxx
	0x6CEA9BFC = We made love on the antique Persian rug in the hall of my apartment. Rough, animalistic sex... just the way I like it. The first one was a little quick but you can't blame the guy. I'm a perfect 10 with pelvic muscles like a nutcracker. I'm heading out right now to meet Heidi and Paige so that we can discuss his girth over cosmopolitans. It's so amazing being a beautiful, intelligent, sexually-aggressive woman with a Middle Park East apartment, stunning clothes and incredible friends. SIGH. Toodles xxxx
	0x9FE452CC = Girls, today might be one of those rare days when you don't wish that you were Alex Chilton. DISASTER DATE! Raise the horror level to RED ALERT! I must have been crazy to think that I could mould that Russian philistine into some kind of sophisticate?!!! He probably doesn't even play tennis. Can you believe that he had the nerve, the barefaced nerve, to take ME to some awful dive bar? I am in shock right now. I've never seen a group of people more in need of cosmetic surgery in my life.
	0x10B7B375 = Today might just have been the worst day of my life. Worse than the time they made me stand in line at Maisonette 9. Worse than the time LC24 photographed me without high heels. Worse than the time my therapist got me pregnant. Worse than the time that so-called investment banker flew me to Vice City in cattle class. Niko took me to this awful fast food restaurant in some ghastly ghetto out in the sticks. I'm lucky to still be alive. My whole outfit is going straight in the trash. The stench of the underclass is something that you can never wash off. As if things couldn't get any worse, two ugly people were kissing at one of the tables.
	0x34B35FD7 = Anyway, must dash. Two weeks to go until my collagen implants... and counting!
	0x39C87714 = So what if I'm having sex with a stranger I met online? Niko certainly isn't complaining. My mother once said that the path to true love is a rocky one, paved with shit and backstreet abortions. Maybe there's some truth in that. Maybe it makes no sense. She was a violent drunk who beat me with a rubber hose for not being pretty enough. Sometimes you have to take one for the team. Sometimes you have to take one from the team. To find Mr. Right, you have to sleep with a lot of Mr. Wrongs. Stay fabulous. Nitey night xxxx
	0x64E67813 = On a brighter note, I spotted this girl with the cutest mole I have ever seen as I was coming out of Fourchette and she's agreed to transplant it from her face to mine for $2000. Bargain or what?!
	0x68D8E7AA = Niko took me out to a restaurant. And I use 'restaurant' in the loosest sense of the word. You're not going to believe this but it was OUTSIDE ALGONQUIN! In one of those hideous boroughs where all the hired help live. Me! Alex Chilton! The girl voted 8th best-dressed socialite in a 2006 poll of Middle Park East trustfunders! I could have died! This place was horrendously tacky and beneath me. I don't think they've ever seen designer clothing in there before. I feel completely used and humiliated and not in a good way. I mean, I am the ultimate catch for a man. Have you seen my tits and ass? Beautiful, intelligent, artistic, uninhibited... there aren't enough adjectives in the dictionary to describe Alex Chilton.
	0x87C23AED = Burning question of the day (and I mean that literally) - clit ring or no clit ring? My mysterious European can't get enough of it but that's no surprise considering he comes from a country where the women have sideburns and no teeth. But maybe that's what guys like? God, so many questions?the meds do that to me sometimes. One minute I'm floating on a fluffy cloud of numb ambivalence, the next I'm talking to my reflection in a shop window.
	0x207A5EF1 = Where is that delivery guy with Valentino's mineral water? Poor little doggy. He must be new. As soon as he sees my tight ass in a pair of booty shorts, he'll never be late again. This morning I got vodka delivered to my door in two minutes flat. Maybe I'll let him feel my new implants tomorrow? He's quite cute for a Mexican. Poor Valentino. There's no way I'm giving him any of that ghetto water out the tap. Speaking of ghettos, my Mysterious European showed me his true colors today. It was his big chance to impress me and where did we go? Ten-pin bowling!
	0x266EDEE3 = UGGH!!! They should ban it or keep them in a special compound or something. Don't get me wrong; I'm more than happy to do my part for the poor people. I'll be the first through the door at a $1,000-a-head charity fundraiser in a little black dress and some strappy sandals. But I don't need to experience their base existence first-hand. I feel like I need to be disinfected or something. I really can't see things working out with this Niko guy. Maybe this kind of approach works for girls in Russia or wherever he's from but this is Alex Chilton, not some peasant girl who works down a mine. I'm going to drink some Pinot, take some painkillers and pray for a full blackout. Toodles xxxxx
	0x596EC8D6 = But maybe that's it. Maybe I am TOO perfect. Maybe I am TOO fashionable. Maybe I scare men away with my supermodel looks and fierce intellect. It must be hard for the average man to handle a party girl at the top of her social game. Not to mention my blog. But that's the whole point: I'm not looking for an average man. A girl like me, a perfect 10 with no gag reflex who can work any room on the face of the planet, deserves to be on the arm of a man with style, taste and means. And I am more than happy to forego the style and taste. Is it too much to ask for an Algonquin loft, a beach home, ski chalet, European pied-a-terre and a yacht in the Caribbean?
	0x791CB460 = Hola chicas! Stop what you're doing and read about my life! Guess what?! I've finally got my Slavic wings! One well-hung immigrant and Alex Chilton has conquered the Balkan Peninsula! Niko and I took our relationship to the next level today. And not before time! We went back to my apartment and I surprised him by changing into my schoolgirl outfit. Bringing out the big guns! Ratatattat!!! He told me that he wanted to be inside me and I swooned. Sometimes men know just the right thing to say.
	0x2258BB22 = My body is so ridiculously toned right now, I can't even begin to tell you. If you didn't know I was 29, you would honestly think it was a high-school cheerleader riding some perverted older guy. I started having flashbacks to my Sweet 16 at one point. I wonder what Coach Jenkins is doing now??? Watching Niko bullfroging me on top of the washing machine got me thinking - could this swarthy foreigner be my knight in shining armor? Might it take a wild animal to tame this party girl?
	0x9682B63A = I'm so happy and buzzed right now. Great friends, amazing clothes, a perfect body, a luxury apartment and a string of rich, successful men lining up to penetrate me. Sometimes I think to myself. Is having everything ever enough?
	0x33065A51 = I just might give up on Craplist. Nobody looks anything like their photos and most of the men I meet are either incontinent senior citizens or perverts. I mean, I'm up for as much exploration of my sexuality as the next girl but even I draw the line at getting fisted by a chimpanzee while its owner watches dressed as a spaceman. What am I doing messing around with these losers? I should stick to hanging out at Maisonette 9 with Heidi and Paige and whispering in men's ears that I'm not wearing any panties. At least the guys there know how to treat a girl - champagne followed by hateful sex. This neanderthal I met tonight wouldn't know his grand cru from his grand cul. A little French joke for you there, girlies!
	0x78789C5E = Love? Sex? Relationships? Scat? Can they be separated? What does it all mean? When did I get that tattoo? Why do I keep waking up on the bathroom floor with no memory of the past 48 hours? Could Niko be the one? Or am I confusing sex with love again? Always be true to yourself, girls. Alex xxxx
	0x94088E9B = My Mysterious European caught me by surprise today with a date to one of my favorite Algonquin restaurants. For a man whose idea of high fashion is matching socks, this was a pleasant surprise and I'm starting to think that romance is in the air for this high society girl! I really wanted to suggest some cream pie for dessert but I'm not sure that he would have picked up on the duble entondrah (that's French, btw :-o). Ah, Paris in the spring... I'm really in uncharted territory here.
	0x176520A5 = Every time I purge eggs benedict, I start thinking about sex. Don't ask me why. It's the same with asparagus. Maybe it's something to do with that night I don't remember with the chef at Gozushi. Anyway, Niko and I are SO totally taking it to the next level sexually. He's such a snarling ball of testosterone!
	0x179554F7 = Hello darlings! How goes it with you? How goes it with me, more importantly?!!!! That's why you're reading this thing, isn't it? To live your own lives vicariously through mine? Well, big date with the Mysterious European to report! Maybe he's not just an uncultured brute with a sexy accent and a bulging package after all. We went for drinks to a swanky bar in Algonquin and I got a little tipsy, I have to admit!
	0x31378827 = Probably because I haven't eaten for 5 days but regular meals won't get you into a size zero dress, chicas! My eyes look smoking when I'm drunk, everybody tells me that. I tried to edge closer to him to pull off my trademark crotch brush at one point but he backed away. I don't think he's used to a liberated woman in killer heels! Toodles for now xxxxxxxx
	0x49917184 = Buckle up and hold on tight, girls, because the rollercoaster that is Alex Chilton's love life is plunging towards rock bottom. In a million years, you would never guess where my Mysterious European took me today. Cocktails on the roof of the Majestic? Shopping at Yogarishma? Facials at Le Chien? I wish. No, Mr. Romantic decided that he would woo me with a game of darts in an Irish Bar! DARTS! It was like everything I'd worked for all my life - the shoes, the killer body, the party invitations - vanished in an instant, stained forever with the filth of the underclass.
	0xA0EA1394 = The way I see it, being a liberated woman is about taking back the power. Giggle like a school girl over dinner and then beat his balls with a rolling pin when you get home. And this has nothing to do with my father, whatever my therapist says. Take Niko, for example, my Mysterious European. A man's man, if ever I saw one. Well, believe me, even tough guys cry when you burn their nipples with a cigarette lighter. He was shaking like a shitting dog by the time he left my place. A thousand-dollar heel up the ass soon separates the men from the boys. Ciao. Alex xxxxx I actually think that my breasts are getting perkier, btw!!!
	0xA4CF3FED = Fuck me I'm a goddess. You have GOT to watch this tape I made of Niko and me getting down and dirty in my apartment! Maybe I should have told him about the video camera but he'd only have gone all European and awkward on me. I'll post it on Electric Tit as soon as I find the right soundtrack. Wow, talk about reaching my sexual peak! The backwards roll into handstand with him still inside me was nothing short of spectacular!
	0xA8BBDAAC = It was the perfect date. Expensive drinks surrounded by beautiful people. That's what life is all about. My life, anyway! I'd been doing blow all day so the last thing I wanted was food or conversation.
	0xA168E816 = Que horror! Somebody hose me down! I'm covered in the germs of the common man. Niko dragged me to the most disgusting bar you have ever seen today. The kind of place where inbred reprobates come to fight and fornicate in between acts of crime. I've seen it on TV. It was terrifying - they all looked at me as if they'd never seen a smoking-hot Algonquin socialite before. There'll be a few men masturbating tonight, I can tell you. If that's his idea of a date, he can go back to Madrid or Moscow or wherever he's from.
	0xA9074588 = There might be more to my Mysterious European than just bad English and skin like leather. He took me out to eat at a borderline-acceptable restaurant in Algonquin today and I didn't even choose it! He's a little rough around the edges - certainly not my usual type! - but he knows how to treat a lady and he is starting to open up to me, I think. I wanted to open myself up to him right there on the table after that meal, I can tell you! I still have no idea what he does or where he lives but that's part of the excitement. The danger turns me on. There's something about those eyes. I'm thinking about how well-hung he is.
	0xB2D5B76B = I've spent the last 6 hours staring at a blank TV screen and now I feel like musing whimsically about what it means to be a modern woman. How do we carve out a sexual identity for ourselves in the 21st century? And I'm not talking about cutting myself after masturbation. That's all in the past and I'm much happier now.
	0xBB467FC1 = Niko earned himself a lot of brownie points today! I might even dress up like a brownie for him, if he plays his cards right. My stomach is so ripped right now, I really could pass for a girl half my age. He took me to this cool spot for cocktails which was just what the doctor ordered. Actually, the doctor ordered me to start eating before I have a heart attack but what does he know? I didn't hear him complaining when he was pile-driving me over the defibrillator.
	0xBD357DEC = Liberated Women! I'm starting to wonder how liberated some of you really are. I just got an email calling me a "spoilt attention-starved slut" who "uses the approval of men to validate her meaningless existence". Er, whatever, bitch!!!! You sound like my therapist. This is the 21st century. We are sassy, independent women. It's not about burning your bra any more. It's about removing it with no hands at the dinner table while flicking a martini olive with the tip of your tongue.
	0xC0AE4C4B = Uggh! I feel physically sick and not just from the tranks I crushed up and rubbed into my gums earlier. If he looks like an uncivilized barbarian, acts like an uncivilized barbarian and talks like an uncivilized barbarian, then he probably is an uncivilized barbarian. I must be out of my mind. What did I expect from an immigrant I met online? I've been humiliated in the worst way possible by a man who almost certainly has never done brunch in his life. Can you believe that he took me bowling? Can you get any more white trash than that?
	0xC2DF7938 = Underlying his gruff, awkward manner is the kind of quiet self-assurance that only comes with a member of a certain size. He doesn't seem to be intimidated by my beauty and intellect. Overawed by it, of course, but not intimidated. I can spot small penis syndrome a mile away. I have a pretty good radar for these things... in fact, I've never met anyone more insightful than me. That's why I blog. To unveil the truths about love and life that lie hidden to all but the most perceptive. Sometimes the truth hurts but so does a champagne bottle up the ass in a penthouse suite. Nobody said that being an Algonquin socialite was easy.
	0xCCDF54E3 = I was talking to Paige about Niko and she told me that people in eastern Europe just shit on the side of the road when the need strikes them. Que horror! My new meds are great, btw. I can get that doctor to sign over half of Holland Hospital Center if I strip nice and slowly. I don't know what it is about Niko but I feel all warm and gooey inside. Could it be love? Or is it just the first rumblings of cocaine diarrhea?
	0xCF088A3E = Nitey night!!!!!
	0xCF868B42 = My butt looks AMAZING in my new Yogarishima culottes, btw!
	0xD9B0D799 = Stick a fork in me. I'm done. My credibility on the Algonquin party circuit has been trampled under the rough hooves of the common herd. I thought that it wasn't possible to sink any lower on a date than that advertising guy who ordered the house wine (I didn't swallow that night on principle) but my Mysterious European plummeted to new depths of barbarity today.
	0xD22C375B = If the poor are so poor, why are they all so fat? Would it kill them to exfoliate once in a while? It was the most demeaning thing that has ever happened to me. I'm used to blowing married men on private jets not fraternizing with the hired help in a disease-infested shithole. I've probably got AIDS.
	0xD262EFB4 = I might as well start wearing polyester and giving birth every three weeks. This is the girl who once flew to Sicily for a cannoli. Which I threw up immediately. I was willing to give Niko some leeway, being a foreigner and all. They don't have the same dating etiquette in the second world. Paige told me that men in Scotland mount women in the streets like dogs. But this might have been the final straw for my Mysterious European. Love is fleeting; a bad reputation lasts a lifetime.
	0xDAACF07E = My Mysterious European took me out on a date to a Russian cabaret club in Broker today. Not the usual hangout for a drop-dead gorgeous Algonquin socialite but I'd been snorting painkillers all day and I have to admit that I quite enjoyed it. Maybe I should have gotten up there and done my trick with the ping pong ball! Those Europeans are so quaint and quirky with all their acts and games. When you don't have a TV or prescription meds, I suppose you'll do anything to get through the day.
	0xE4F2F82A = Oh the shame of it! My reputation is in tatters. If the press finds out that Alex Chilton was playing darts, I am finished in this town. You can't bounce back from something like that. Niko thought that it would be a fun thing for us to do together. Er, maybe on the Balkan Peninsular, sweetheart, but this is Algonquin. My idea of a fun date is ordering a $200-salad, not eating it, blacking out on wine and riding a married hedge fund manager in the back of a limo.
	0xE9E6F805 = I can hardly bring myself to admit this but I played POOL. Alex Chilton! If I wasn't so zoned on coke and painkillers, I'm not sure that I would be able to handle the shame right now. Thank god for my art. What would I do without my blog? Writing is my outlet, a way of channeling my innermost thoughts and fears into something meaningful, something that will inspire liberated women of the world to be the best that they can be. Toodles for now. Alex xxxxx
	0xE91DB8C4 = I've always liked it a bit rough, I suppose, but never in public like this! If Paige and Heidi saw Niko, they would just DIE! I often think back to the gardener at my parents' place upstate and wince a little, in a good way. Those filthy finger nails and stubble like sandpaper. Mmmmmmm. Yummy. No wonder I failed my SATs! Then my bitch of a mother found out and tried to cancel all my store cards. I hate her. I wish she'd hurry up and die. If she didn't pay my bills, I'd never speak to the drug-addled cow again.
	0xE1532ED3 = Then I got home and ate a blueberry muffin at around 250 calories. I am so weak sometimes. Going on a 4-day water fast tomorrow. Maybe a couple of cocktails to take the edge off. Nico has never heard of a bloody mary... can you believe that?!!!! Watch this space.
	0xEB4842C5 = His accent is so deep and erotic. As soon as he saw me, I could tell that he was undressing me with his eyes. Dark, brooding eyes. There's something so raw, so masculine about him. We talked for hours. Well, I did most of the talking. He is more of the strong silent type. Somehow I don't think he's a lawyer, though. Not sure that I am going to be able to introduce him to Heidi and Paige just yet!
	0xEE72CEC1 = It's never going to be a substitute for getting sandwiched by two corporate lawyers in the back of a limousine but perhaps some blue collar loving was just what the doctor ordered? Well, actually, the doctor ordered me to stop doing coke before I have another heart attack but you know what I mean. Sometimes when you have steak every day, you just want a greasy burger. Do we spend too much time chasing the wrong men? Could Mr. Right be the plumber or construction worker? Or are they just like mopeds? Fun to ride until your friends find out? Toodle pip xxxx
	0xF95497F0 = He plays his cards close to his chest but, if he wants to get his hands on mine again, he's going to have to raise his game big time. And I want to see a copy of his bank balance. I'm starting to think that he might not be an oligarch or oil tycoon after all. It's about time this mysterious European got a bit less mysterious. Ciao xxx
	0xFD19E668 = Guess what! I went on another date with a guy from craplist today. And he's not a sex offender! As far as I can tell, anyway. This whole online thing is finally starting to work out for me. It's a much easier way to meet men than leaning over tables of drunken investment bankers with my breasts pushed together. I suppose that I have become a bit more picky since that guy mixed me a drink and I woke up on an operating table in Peru three days later. Doctors get me swooning every time. He's called Niko and he's from Russia or Europe or somewhere like that.

	0x01765F39 = My look today is very boho chic... floaty skirt, cowboy boots, chunky belt. I'm the BOMB!
	0x026CE39F = LiberatedWoman says: OMFG! What?
	0x05F65359 = -----Transcript-------
	0x0C8678FA = LiberatedWoman says: Why would I be on fire?
	0x0FBAFBC2 = Trent drove me out to his place in the Carraways this weekend. We had dinner under the stars. He tied me up with a ball in my mouth and invited some of his golf buddies over. The next morning, I put my hair in pigtails and came down to breakfast in one of his white shirts. Uber sexy. He calls me his little slut bucket which is soooo sweet!! He told that me he is going to leave his wife. Fingers crossed! I'm sitting in my apartment right now, smoking a cigarette and looking out at the hustle and bustle in the streets below. Liberty City is my city and I love it!
	0x2F5F08A5 = Wow. What a night! Talk about a martini fest! Heidi, Paige and I went out on the hunt for investment bankers. I have set myself a deadline of next summer for the wedding and the clock is ticking! We walked straight to the front of the line, as usual. All the doormen in Liberty City know us! A handjob can get you a long way in this town. Within a couple of minutes, Heidi had spotted a table of diamante cufflinks and $1000 brogues in the VIP area and we made our move. At one point, I did my trick with the ping pong ball, the one that I learned on the pageant circuit. I met this wonderful guy called Trent. As he was fingering me at the coat check, I got to thinking... can relationships really work in the 21st century? Or are we just fumbling in the dark? Never compromise who you are, girls.
	0x2FF43C2C = HELLLLLOOOOO! This will have to be a quick post. I have a date tonight. Wish me luck!
	0x3FC6B0A8 = Nothing is certain in life except death, taxes and MEN DON'T STAND UP ALEX CHILTON!!! Who does that Serbian peasant think he is? If this leaks onto the party circuit, I might never purge another canapé again. If he puts the future of my social life in jeopardy, I'll make sure he never drinks another cocktail in this town again. He should be spending every minute of every day thanking Apollo or whoever it is they worship over there for the opportunity to even breathe the same air as Alex Chilton! Is he out of his fucking mind?
	0x4BBAE0E9 = What a bunch of whores! Flaunting themselves for money and male attention. And I was so much cuter than any of them. I wonder how often Niko goes to these places??? Maybe it's time to give him a blowjob while he's driving? That's the best way to get a man to fall in love with you. And if you suck his balls and put your finger up his ass, you are almost guaranteed a marriage proposal. Is that a little too candid for you, girls? Well, fuck it. This is the 21st century and graphic discussions about sex with your girlfriends over brunch is what defines you as a liberated woman. I'm SO happy with my thighs right now, btw. The definition is nothing short of spectacular. Ciao for now xxx
	0x5AF015C4 = LiberatedWoman says: Um, is this thing still on?
	0x6C2A3838 = Mike says: I am a school principal
	0x6E14FED6 = Anyway, it turned out that this guy from craplist was a 70-year-old with a prosthetic leg and breath like dog shit. The old perv had sent me his grandson's photo! But the restaurant was top-notch and I was looking smoking hot in a vintage ballerina skirt, Le Chien chiffon blouse and Enema cowboy boots so I decided to pound the martinis and make the best of it. And guess what?!! He's got more money than a third-world country! Never judge a book by its cover - that's what I always say. As his cracked lips parted and his rancid tongue flicked at the back of my tonsils, I thought to myself... is money enough? Could I fall for a man who wets himself during the appetizer and sleeps through dessert? If he continues to order $700 bottles of wine, then the answer might just be yes. SIGH. When did relationships become so complicated? xxxxxxx
	0x7BCA9CB4 = I'm wearing skinny jeans, ballet pumps and a low-cut cashmere sweater. SMOKING HOT! So what's new? Paige got a diamond necklace from this guy she's blowing which is 100% fab and gorgeous. Five figures at least. We all screamed and jumped up and down for about 20 minutes while looking around to see if any guys were checking us out.
	0x8EDEFDAD = Mike says: Kinky shit
	0x25D5AA70 = LiberatedWoman says: You need help
	0x37A14E07 = Mike says: I have a red catsuit
	0x49A0EAAA = Chicas! I can't believe I forgot about this! Why do I always black out when I mix the yellow pills with the blue pills? Anyway, Niko has been arrested! Of all my many experiences with handcuffs, this has got to be the strangest. I've spent the last hour playing the ham banjo at my bedroom window while pretending that my neighbor can't see me. All this danger and suspense is a bit of a turn-on, I can tell you. Can this Mysterious European get any more mysterious? Maybe he's a mafia kingpin with millions of dollars in offshore accounts? Who would play me in the movie? Samantha Muldoon? No, she's WAY too fat.
	0x52DD2B8D = It doesn't even bear thinking about. I mean, I'm all for a bit of spontaneity and excitement on a date. A blowjob in the elevator. A line of toot off a stripper's clit. A crocodile clip and some candle wax. But not this. Anything but this. I'm terrified! What do I really know about this guy? He could be a murderer or a rapist or anything. Maybe he's a fan whose masturbatory fantasy has morphed into a sadistic obsession? He wouldn't be the first. This is a disaster. My life is in danger and I'm out of tranks. I'm going to call up my personal trainer. I can't sleep alone tonight...
	0x83ABE7A1 = I worked on my calves for two hours at the gym today. Calves are sooooo important, girls! Trent hasn't called. Neither has Brad, Cort or Steve. Sometimes I think that I might be better off by myself. Just Valentino and petite little me. I guess that some men can't cope with a successful, intelligent, beautiful woman. I am Alex Chilton, goddamn it! I am the voice for a generation of liberated women. I have a great apartment, amazing shoes and an ass like a cheerleader. Most importantly, though, I have incredible friends. Remember, chicas - no matter how many times men screw you over, your girlfriends will always be there to feed you booze and light your cigarettes. Love and kisses to Heidi and Paige!!!! xxxxx
	0x85BA1A43 = Valentino went toilet before in his Didier Sachs carrying pouch - so gross! It's amazing how much can come out of such a tiny chihuahua! Heidi tells me that the vet can do an operation to make the bowel smaller. Note to self: sort out Valentino's disgusting poop problem.
	0x95B8E683 = I'm just not meeting enough guys on the party circuit so I've decided to post another ad on craplist. A liberated woman doesn't sit back and wait for Mr. Right to come to her! Right, girls? You have to take control, put yourself out there, meet strange men in swanky bars, giggle, play with your hair and then sleep with them on the first night. Toodles. Alexxxxxx
	0x130B84DC = Mike says: IRL
	0x581E193E = I went to the hippest after-party in Liberty City tonight. Everyone who's anyone in the fashion industry was there. One of Daddy's partners invited me. I think that he wants to make love to me. Actually he already has, according to Heidi, but I was zoned on painkillers and Cherenkov at the time. Hehe! Actually, that reminds me - Daddy needs to clear my credit card balance again. I hooked up with this music producer called Brad.
	0x736BF5A7 = Sorry that I haven't posted for a while. Missed me?
	0x746D0B7E = Newsflash girls!!! I had a casual encounter with a man from craplist tonight! Well, I say casual. As you know, Alex Chilton doesn't do casual! My nightgown probably costs more than your car. You cannot predict when Mr. Right is going to come into your life and some slapdash mascara or a pair of old jeans could be the difference between a million-dollar engagement ring and living out your days as a barren, alcoholic spinster.
	0x1545F400 = Que horror! Daddy had the nerve to suggest that I get a job. I have never been more offended in my life. I'm a visionary, I blog. Is it not more important to weave some art into life's rich tapestry, to let my creative juices seep out like a snailtrail on a black bedspread? Wow, I am on fire today. And I'm not just talking about the chlamydia. I have straddled the line between prose and poetry and I am grinding it seductively. That reminds me. I have to tell you about my date with Niko. We went to a stripclub! I KNOW! And they say romance is dead! It was quite an eye-opener for a girl of my upbringing and social standing, I can tell you. And a leg-opener.
	0x1834F7D6 = Mike says: My name is mike
	0x5746D13A = If you learn one thing from me today (and you will probably learn more than one), NEVER leave the house without full makeup, lacy underwear and dusting your landing strip with glitter.
	0x986655EB = This is what happens when you ski off-piste. Heidi warned me about breaking with the program. I should stick to screwing married businessmen in expensive hotel suites and musing about what it means to be a modern woman. If it ain't broke, don't fix it. Anyway, let's hope my Mysterious European has a VERY good excuse for his no-show. There are plenty more fish in the sea and most of them are swimming in my direction. Sweet dreams! Alex xxxx
	0x5189542D = Even if you put my personality and intellect aside, I am a perfect 10 for fuck's sake. If there was an 11 out of 10, I'd be an 11. I can get reservations at any restaurant and VIP entry at any club. I blend vintage and modern effortlessly and I'm fairly close to being famous. Fucking country bumpkin. Well, it's his loss. I was even wearing my crotchless panties... or was I? I don't have them now, either way. Who knows? It takes me all my time to remember to get out of bed in the morning. Thank fuck for medication
	0x35184131 = When your life is an endless whirlwind of heels, cocktails and rich men, sometimes it is easy to forget that you're a neo-feminist. Getting a man to take you shopping in Paris for the weekend and then never answering his calls. Giving a guy a handjob in exchange for free drinks and coke all night in Maisonette 9. Don't let men control you, girls. Take back the power. Talk loudly about penis size with your girlfriends. We are not shallow whores well past our prime! We are liberated women. We're changing the world one gin-and-tonic at a time.
	0x44518114 = Toodles!!!!xxxxxx
	0xA090210F = LiberatedWoman says: uh
	0xA1D34978 = I'll be honest with you. I should have posted this earlier but I was too embarrassed. Why do men always have to ruin everything?!!!! I had it all planned. I was going to take Niko back to my place and crawl across the floor with my butt in the air. Slow and seductive. Like a panther but with a perfect C cup and $1000 heels. One of my signature moves. Then, he goes and gets arrested! Oh, the shame of it! What if somebody saw me?!!
	0xA2066DEE = Alex xxxxx
	0xA2170B8C = Mike says: That's hot
	0xA2892D3E = I think the only way I'm going to be able to get through this is to drink wine with Heidi and Paige and quip sardonically about the complexity of modern relationships. Then black out and have sex with a random stranger. Sometimes you don't know what you had until it's gone. Sometimes you don't know where you are for a couple of days. Sometimes you don't remember writing your blog. Nobody said it was easy being a party girl. Alex xxx
	0xA9717801 = Well, at least one of us is getting showered with expensive gifts. The only thing that I've been showered with recently is the urine of that pervy fitness instructor. Niko didn't even show up for our date today. There must have been some kind of terrible misunderstanding or accident.
	0xB2B12CD0 = Bonjour!
	0xB5F0E451 = I'm spring cleaning today in my booty shorts, just because I can. My neighbor came round earlier to borrow some milk and was checking me out so badly. I am sure that all I had to do was touch him and we would have been fucking on the carpet. I think that he's in love with me. His name is John and he's an architect. I invited him over for a glass of wine tonight. One glass... yeah right! I know that I'll probably get shloshed and seduce him. i might wear my tennis outfit and do some coke to make my face flushed. I've never played but the little skirts drive guys wild. My thighs are so taut right now.
	0xB35CC6A8 = Mike says: U dum ho
	0xB87F970F = I was thinking earlier that my life is like a Vinewood blockbuster where I'm the star and the blogosphere is one big movie theater full of low income women sharing bargain soda&popcorn combos and dreaming of being me. Now that's what I call a metaphor! I really have been taking my prose to a different level in the past couple of weeks. If only my English teacher could see me now! By the way, thanks for that A+, Mr. Hopkins, but a word of advice - it wouldn't kill you to wash your balls once in a while. It smelt like week-old roadkill down there!
	0xB737D770 = Sweet dreams!!!!xxx
	0xB54752BA = Ok, it's time to come clean. I was trying to protect you but there's no point in hiding this any longer. I think that Niko might be dead! It's such a blur and I still don't really know what happened. Coherent recollection is near impossible on these new meds. He's in the hospital now, fighting for his life. Fighting for love.
	0xBD9CC297 = LiberatedWoman says: I am on fire
	0xBDF24352 = Can you believe some of the lines I get from guys on Instant message?
	0xC0F114A7 = We watched some hilarious stand-up by this English guy called Ricky Gervais. He was SO checking me out during his performance. They're not used to girls like me in England. Have you ever seen their soap operas?!! Lots of miserable hags sitting around in smoky pubs moaning about their lives. I've often thought that I could be a comedian. Lots of people tell me that I'm the funniest person they know. I certainly think so. Axxxxx
	0xC3B55BA1 = Hola chicas! Guess what! I went out for dinner with Cort tonight. The restaurant was muy trendy and full of the coolest people. I looked smoking in my black Derriere dress and knee-boots. I put some gloss on my cleavage (hot tip, girls!) so that my puppies would glisten in the candle light. I don't know what they put in lobster but it makes me so horny. Maybe it's just because it's so expensive... I made him come with my foot under the table... it was sooooo romantic. I think that he might be the one. Our waitress was a little on the chubby side and looked so out of place, poor thing. I saw the envy in her eyes as she ran her eyes over my rock-hard body and it got me thinking how many girls must long to BE ME. It is easy to forget sometimes how interesting my life must be to all my readers. I promise to post more often. Toodles for now.
	0xC65CF5BA = It turns out he knows Trent and that my ping pong ball trick is the talk of the racket club! How funny!! I ended up going back to his place in Suffolk with another guy called Steve. Tres stylish loft. They both took turns and then called me a taxi. I felt like a princess. On the way home, I started to think about the person I am and the person I want to be. Does love really matter or is a three-way enough?
	0xC87A0CD4 = Take a deep breath. I've got some bad news, girls. I can't keep pretending it never happened. I should have told you before, I know, but Niko is in the hospital! Que horror! I've haven't had a guy die on me since that judge in the honeymoon suite at Opium Nights. A 68-year-old man, a gram of special K and my tight little ass was always going to be a recipe for disaster. That reminds me; I've got to make sure the kid never manages to track me down through his adoptive parents.
	0xC522EA34 = Mike says: I want to paddle you
	0xC9217109 = Retarded!
	0xCB1158AE = Apparently, he's huge at the moment (career-wise, anyway). Money and fame get me dripping faster than some lube and an electric toothbrush. I might go back there tomorrow in a little black dress and some strappy sandals. Anyway, must dash - my personal trainer arrives in half an hour and I need to glitter up my landing strip. He's hung like a racehorse that guy! I'm looking forward to a punishing workout. Not that I'll remember any of it... I just necked a fifth of bourbon and half a bottle of Silencers. Toodles!!!!!!!
	0xCB235912 = Wow I look good today. My skin has an amazing glow to it. The doorman was SO checking me out again as I left the apartment building. It must be awful to be ugly and poor. It took me about 5 hours to put together my outfit this morning. Getting the right combination of vintage and couture can be a real challenge and that mystery red pill I found in the bathroom cabinet didn't seem to speed up the process.
	0xCCF902F6 = DARLINGS!!!
	0xCF856668 = Mike says: Really?
	0xD3860D4E = Talk about a HANGOVER!!! Paige invited me to this hot new bar on Middle Park East last night. No point in moping around at home, right girls?! A few bottles of champagne and a mountain of powder later and Heidi's wearing her ankles for earrings and my face is buried in some tres fine Egyptian cotton pillows. They were both lawyers. Watch this space!
	0xD6408C6F = Mike says: Have a cam?
	0xD2426710 = Hola! Guess where your favorite party girl ended up today? At a comedy club! How deliciously tacky and low-end is that? It was Niko's idea and I was too jacked up on painkillers to argue. I thought that I was going to hate it but it turned out to be good fun. Katt Williams did this brilliant stand-up routine - like me, he seems to be tapped into the zeitgeist of popular culture, albeit in a different social echelon.
	0xDB328DCF = Off the top of my head, I can't actually think of anyone who ticks all the boxes like me. I'd have to play myself, I think. And direct. I've often thought that I could be a film-maker. I find that I am able to visualize a lot. I see something happen in a shop or a nightclub and I think to myself - wow, Alex, I can totally imagine recording that on a camera and playing it back on a screen. Can you see my perfectly-shaped calves sashaying up the red carpet at the Oscars? Of course you can. What a week! How incredibly wild is my life in comparison with yours?!!!!
	0xDD5EFD89 = Speaking of mystery, Niko hasn't been returning any of my calls, which is strange. Why are men so intimidated by brains and beauty? I'm only compatible with alpha males of obscene wealth and I'm starting to worry that Niko might be a beta male of disgustingly-moderate means. And do you want to hear something really funny? Paige reckons she saw Niko driving a cab! Er, whatever babe! Considering she vomits on an hourly basis and hasn't been sober since the late 80s, I find it best to take all her observations with a large pinch of salt. And a large pinch of snow.
	0xDE0E9AE3 = Are there no single men left in Liberty City? Another night without a date! Que horror! I've decided that I'm going to stay in and give Valentino a rose bath and then practice that cute little smile that I do when I wrinkle my nose.
	0xE09B1838 = You combine model looks with intellectual depth and what do you have? A woman with a duty to share herself with the world. Sometimes I just sit there and think, like a college professor or something. I stare at nothing, full of vague recollections and flickering images. Big news, btw! My fling with the Mysterious European is officially flung. I mean, let's not beat around the bush - a guy like him and a girl like me were never going to last. My tampons are custom-made, for fuck sake! My lunch bill probably costs more than his rent. My girlie laugh and collection of strappy shoes are envied by women the world over.
	0xE4E9A620 = Toodles xxxx
	0xE7FA2FE2 = LiberatedWoman says: Are you retarded?
	0xE97A9A62 = LiberatedWoman says: kay> big deal
	0xECFC38BE = Toodle Pip xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
	0xEECFF064 = Girls! My Mysterious European took me out to a comedy club today. I was all geared up for a night of champagne and violent sex in the back of a limo but you can't expect every date to be perfect. Did I tell you that I have mastered the art of purging and snorting coke at the same time, btw? I am in and out of the restroom in less than 10 seconds these days.
	0xEED934B4 = It was fun while it lasted but he was so beneath me, it's unreal. And he had the nerve to call me unstable. No, it's auf wiedersehen to you, Mr. Bellitch. I'm didn't get to the top of every VIP list by dating men who order from the first page of the wine list. You win some, you lose some. There's always another married investment banker waiting in the wings to screw a girl like me during his lunchhour. I'm just glad that the endless glitz and glamour that is my life, brings some meaning to yours. Snaring a husband in Algonquin is my number 1 priority. No more drunken encounters with random men off craplist. From now on, my panties are staying up until I see evidence of a second home and a black High Life card. Oh, who am I trying to kid?! Sexual promiscuity defines me as a strong, independent woman.
	0xF639E853 = I'll get Daddy on the case. It seems like so long ago now. So does this morning, though. When you start your day with a handful of Silencers, by lunch your breakfast feels like it happened some time last year. Not that I eat breakfast or lunch but you know what I mean. Anyway, my Mysterious European is on his deathbed! The doctors are doing all they can but I'm not sure he's going to make it. Talk about a disaster date. I'm going to run myself a bubblebath and try to forget about the bloodbath. If I could feel anything, I'm sure that I would be devastated. Nitey night! xxxxx
	0xFAC45576 = Mike says: No
	0xFBBA3EE1 = Mike says: What R U wearing?

BLOGEL
{
	0x018BB456 = That man in the pet shop is beautiful, in an unfathomable way.
	0x0947D4BA = Eddie went to take out some money from a bank today. Actually, from a banker. I cut it out of his pocket in the elevator. He had a nice face. I will go and wait for him tomorrow. I found some photos of Eddie in his little sailor's outfit earlier!!! Oh, how Eddie wanted to be a sailor!!! Then they locked me up in that camp for bad boys. Now it's just me alone in the world. And mother. Is that you, mother? No, it's just Eddie in mother's underwear. Bad Eddie. Such a bad little boy.
	0x5C7BF9EA = It's time for me to speak to the world. To tell you who I am. To be famous, like I will be. I thought that the Internets were just for buying breast milk but I'm learning that they're so much more. All these millions of shadowy figures jostling for visibility. Are you alone in the dark waiting for Eddie? I'm finally starting to feel part of something; that I'm wired into a cosmos, a COMMUNITY. Eddie's never had any friends, except for Boo Boo Wilkins. I hate that cat. I hate that cat. I hate that cat. Always wailing and whining and wanting to be petted. I'll pet you, Boo Boo Wilkins - with a fucking cheese grater!!!!!! NO! Eddie would never hurt Boo Boo Wilkins.
	0x5EECA6AC = Mix it up and make it nice,
	0x6AB31658 = Boo Boo Wilkins never made Eddie grow his hair long and wear a dress to school. Where is father now? Sleeping, Eddie, sleeping. I set up a MyRoom page yesterday but nobody has contacted me for anal sex yet. I saw a documentary about it on TV. I don't watch a lot of tv. Mother never allowed it. Just cartoons and wildlife programs.
	0x77E0A8A3 = Oh, how it smells in here. You've got to clean the house. DO YOUR CHORES!!! Nasty, nasty Eddie.
	0x87FA92AE = The thought of you reading my weblog is quite a turn-on I can tell you. Trust me, it's not true. I make it all up, just like they make up where little boys and little girls come from. Lots of things turn me on - trepanation, armadillos, yeast infections - but I have to learn to control myself. Mother caught Eddie pumping devil paste out of his peanut one day and made me sleep in the dog kennel. I never liked that dog. The way it looked at me when I made it lick jam off my peanut. Those judging eyes. I made a finger puppet out of its esophagus. Nobody has contacted me on MyRoom yet. I just want to meet a nice girl. Or a boy. Where was Eddie tonight? Why am I in mother's nightgown?
	0x188E19F0 = Eddie's big Saturday night in: 1 bottle of sweet sherry. Check. Neighbor's puppy. Check. Floor sander. Check.
	0x340BD0EB = Half a pint of bourbon,
	0x573F72C7 = Such a horrible way for mother to die. How could someone do such a thing? They tried to say that Eddie did it but I was too clever. WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT CAT DOING NOW!!! Why would Eddie ever want to keep his mother's breasts in a shoebox under the bed, officer? I can wrap the police round my little finger. I have some vocal cords wrapped around my little finger right now. Not so chatty now, are you, my love? That silly girl at the hardware store. Smiling at Eddie when he bought the chicken wire. Smiling at Eddie when he bought the duct tape. All Eddie wanted to do was nurse on her but she had to play hard to get. Games. Always games. I've got a game for you. FIND YOUR EYES. How can it be 4pm? Time for bed. When did Eddie last sleep? It takes Eddie so long to go to bed. So many rituals...
	0x3543A956 = Still no friends on MyRoom. And I made a real effort to be approachable in my profile as well. People don't get Eddie and Eddie doesn't get people. Eddie had a girlfriend once. He kept her in the cellar. In fact, she must still be down there. Maybe it's because I'm an only child. Well, I am now, anyway. They found Eddie's brother in the pond. WHEN WILL THAT TAP STOP DRIPPING????????????????????????? Drip, drip, drip. I can feel the itch starting again; the itch that has to be scratched. I MUST GET STRONGER. You think Eddie's invisible, do you? You think you can just look at your feet and walk on by? Nobody listens to Eddie. But you will. You will hear my silence and feel my breath. Je suis un monstre.
	0x51958BFE = Pop! goes the abdomen.
	0x81822FB7 = Eddie slept in the garden last night. Oh, what fun! What delightful fun! Under the apple tree. Then the birds starting chirping, drilling into my head with their messages of doom and subversion. I remember playing in that tree as a boy. Little Eddie with his little peanut. Look at Low! It's like a maggot! How I hated those showers. So many schools, so many showers, so many people to find. Remember me, Pennington? Remember me, Owens? Remember me, Dodson? Eddie is all grown up now and wants to show you what he knows about musculoskeletal manipulation. The itch is getting worse. What day is it? Tuesday? Friday? Is it fish today, mother? Must get out for a wander. Scratch that itch.
	0x887379B9 = Eddie made a joke. Eddie made a joke. Oh no, now Eddie made a poo poo.
	0xA5AAFC86 = Eddie is happy today. And when I say happy, I mean empty and numb, like you are supposed to feel when the drugs kick in. I dressed up Boo Boo Wilkins like a baby and he licked gravy off my nipple. He's the luckiest cat in the whole wide world. What is that smell? Granny? Not on the mouth, PLEASE granny. How nice Eddie's hands are! Long, smooth fingers like a pianist. Eddie used to play the oboe until he lost it up the rectum of a park ranger. Back in the good old days before they all went away.
	0xA10925B2 = That Detective Atkinson is a moron. He'll never catch me. He can't even come up with a name for me. All he's interested in is getting his picture in the newspaper. I'm supposed to be the one getting the attention! Everybody thinks they can ignore Eddie. Well, maybe I am invisible. Maybe you can't see me. But another head is looking me straight in the eye right now. This is just the beginning, Atkinson. Complacency. Apathy. Indulgence. Is this what humanity has come to? Is this the civilization for which man was destined? If so, I don't want to be part of it. The gene pool is polluted. You do not deserve life. You make me want to puke. In fact, I'm going to.
	0xA8010136 = Eddie went out to play again earlier. Bad Eddie. Another zit on the back of society has been popped. He looked troubled, then startled, then quiet. His balls are in a glass next to my bed. My freezer is getting very full. Time for one of Eddie's famous casseroles. Boo Boo Wilkins loves Eddie's casseroles.
	0xC3AD4B93 = Eddie has been a naughty boy. I only went for a walk by the river, mother, I promise. There's a jogger in the bushes. I HATE JOGGERS!! You are given the greatest gift of all - life - and what do you do with it? Jog. Fucking narcissists! LOOK AT ME. Look at me lunge and stretch. Look at me hopping in place while I wait for the lights to change. Oooooh, I'm not going to run, I'm not going to walk - I'm going to JOG. Get off the fucking fence before I impale you on it. Ooops, I already have. I brought the head back for Boo Boo Wilkins but he isn't impressed. That cat has got ideas too big for its britches. I like to cut the heads off joggers to see if they keep on running, like chickens. Sometimes the only difference between making love and making hate is a turn of the wrist. So tired...
	0xCAC87930 = That's better. I'll clean it up later. Will you Eddie, will you?
	0xD14ECEC3 = Boo Boo Wilkins has ruined my day again. That cat is more devious than I ever imagined. I can see ridicule in its eyes - the animal actually believes that it is superior to me in some way. Must be terrible being a eunuch but that's what happens when you decide that the litter tray is optional. Eddie pooped in the litter tray once. It's not so bad.

	0xF1EEB4CF = Nobody enters the house. EVER. Except for Boo Boo Wilkins, of course. Here kitty kitty. He killed a bird today and I ejaculated. Bad Eddie. I rubbed lemon juice on my peanut like Mother told me to. I stay in the house and I am alone; I go outside and all I see are imbeciles. Pointless morons treading water in a stagnant pool of mediocrity. Breeding, multiplying. Evolution has been halted and we are in regression. The human race is in decline. But Eddie gave natural selection another helping hand today. I left a present for you in a sports bag, Detective Atkinson! Another diseased soul vaccinated with a blow torch and a trowel. DO YOU SEE ME NOW??!! Fate is always around the corner, next door, a heartbeat away. Watching, whispering, waiting.

The killer, who's yet to be given a nickname, seems to have a particular thing against keep-fit enthusiasts as the three victims so far were joggers. Each had been decapitated after running late at night. It seems we are in for a news bonanza as we consider the ramifications of this terrifying case in gruesome detail and try to figure out exactly who will star in the movie.

Of course, following years of being attacked by law enforcement, the Mafia are in decline, but bear in mind it also serves them to exaggerate the extent of their decline so people leave them alone."

Crime in Liberty has changed as the population has changed, and the recent bloodbath in a Hove Beach nightclub has shone a light on the murky world of the underworld. The police have few links with these newer communities in our city, and language barriers often make it harder for them to find out what is going on, so crime has run riot in a way not seen since the passing of the RICO act in the 1970s.

The body had been badly mutilated and taken advantage of, and police have still not identified the victim. Local residents are starting to panic. One local heavy-set woman, Siobhan Phillips, told us, "They say keeping fit is good for you; well, it wasn't good for this man - he went running and had his head chopped off by a maniac." Of greater concern for many is the failure by our police force to name the killer. Surely a man who chops off heads for fun could inspire a funny nickname or moniker of some sort?

In the old days, we'd make racist jokes and have a great time; now people get all excited about racial equality, and the result - anarchy on our streets."

The mob in Liberty City is being weakened, but it's just opening up room for new gangsters coming to town. The Alderney-based mobsters are trying to take control of Liberty City rackets and gangsters are coming in from Eastern Europe. These guys are even worse than the likes of Vito Dog Meat.

In a moment of hubris, he also unsuccessfully sued God for letting it rain on his parade. The killer gained entrance to the offices of Goldberg, Ligner and Shyster where Mr. Goldberg was a partner. Dick Shyster, another partner in the firm, eulogized Mr. Goldberg in a press release, "Tom will be sorely missed by all the people he got off.

Witnesses report a heated argument outside Videogeddon arcade, an establishment where addicts pump quarters into computers to get their fix of horrific violence. The argument was followed by a chase on motorbikes then his grizzly murder. It is no surprise that upset community leaders are pointing to games as the cause of this death; the pattern of altercation, vehicle chase, murder, rebirth and try again is common in video games. Although Mr. Simson was a known drug user and dealer with several convictions, we are certain this case is due to polygons and pixels not parole boards.

Fans of the movie franchise often dress as their favorite character from the movie and speak in Middle English. Police say the fans argue over movie minutia within the smallest point of trivia sometimes leading to violent conflict. The assailant in the altercation is still being sought by police, but witnesses say he was dressed in a jester costume and playing a lute when he got involved in an argument with the victim about whether it was a realistic plot point that a dragon could breed with a horse. The argument turned violent with the jester seizing the victim's sword and fatally wounding him. Police are requesting any court jesters in the area to come forward voluntarily so that they can eliminate them from their inquiries.

At the time, it was presumed that O'Malley had friends in criminally high places. Now it seems he was freed so he could be silenced, or punished for past crimes. Police have no leads on what might have been behind the need to silence or kill Mr. O'Malley, 48. O'Malley was born and raised in Dukes but spent much of his adult life in Ireland and Britain, where he was thought to have links with several paramilitary and terrorist groups.

It is also believed that Torres murdered Bohan community leader, Manny Escuela, and documentary film maker, Jay Hamilton. They have been missing for several weeks but police cannot bring charges until their bodies are discovered. The District Attorney submitted hundreds of hours of surveillance audio in the trial.

Suspicions as to the pilot's state of mind had been raised even before take-off when he welcomed passengers "aboard the party bus" and announced that, "in the unlikely event of landing on water, the woman in 15B has two beautiful flotation devices." Over the course of the 2-hour flight, he became audibly more boisterous and incoherent singing, "Who wants to sit on the captain's knee?" and shouting things like "Kamikaze" and "Look no hands" as the plane came into land. "He even asked an air hostess for a sickbag at one point," said one terrified passenger. The 48-year-old father of two was questioned by Francis International authorities before driving home.

However, they have stated that several suspects have been airlifted from Liberty City to an offshore questioning centre. These massacres have changed the spirit of Alderney forever. No more will that patch of land on the other side of the West River be associated with good working-class values, polluted swamps, spray-on tans, big hair, violent racist masculinity and other American-as-apple-pie attitudes of the suburbs.

Well, crime expert Jimmy Cast for starters. He told us, "Mobsters are all vain - this war is not only a war for financial power, it is also a war for social control over the city. Expect more bodies to turn up before things calm down. The Alderney mob are known to be lawless and I imagine the older families will also be nervous as the DA's office uses this as an opportunity to indict several mobsters across the city in another massive crackdown on organized crime."

In an act of desperation, Pathmanson attempted to install a firewall and new motherboard in the toaster, at which point hackers switched it on and electrocuted him.

His bride, Mallorie Bellic, was unavailable for a statement. Witnesses report that a man approached the wedding party outside the church, shot Mr. Bellic, and then turned the gun on himself. Mr. Bellic's cousin, Niko, was reported to have left the scene soon after the murder. He is being sought for questioning in the case but not as a suspect.

Police believe he attacked the wrong person, and was himself killed in a fight. Detective Jon Atkinson told this newspaper, "It is very disappointing. I was just about to make an arrest. I'd solved the case. His name was Eddie Low. He lived in Dukes - I was literally heading over to his house when the news came in another body had turned up. Obviously, the screenplay I am writing about the case will now have a slightly different ending, in which I make the arrest, and it will carry the subtitle 'based on true events', because that will make a better story."

That's why we started the Liberty City Lip Reading Bee." The Lip Reading Bee has replaced the Spelling Bee after the rise in computer-assisted spellchecking programs have made Americans unable to even write a sentence without computer assistance. The Bee ended in scandal yesterday as the C word was mouthed repeatedly at judges who were also called pedophiles by angry contestants.

Mr. Gravelli, 85, had been residing at the Schottler Medical Center for the last 3 years. Although some in the DA's office argued that this was a ruse to avoid a court case, Mr. Gravelli never left hospital after being admitted. Mr. Gravelli has been head of the Gambetti crime syndicate since 1978 and under his stewardship, the family had become the most powerful of Liberty City's crime families, rivaling the Pavano family. Although he had been indicted several times, Mr. Gravelli was never convicted of a serious crime. Some believed he had contacts within the government who protected him, and for whom he would get criminal associates to perform hits and other crimes, but these allegations were never substantiated.

Mr. Kapowitz plans to take his newfound wealth down to Vice City where he will start a gun shop and liquor store, "They're real men down there and they need real guns and liquor in one convenient location." Mr. Kapowitz's ownership of the diamonds was immediately contested by over 100 people. Mayor Ochoa decided that it would be impossible to verify the claims so allowed Mr. Kapowitz to keep all of the proceeds from the diamonds' sale.

To blame police priorities for rising crime is patently absurd. When arresting jay walkers or protecting film sets around the city, our officers are more than willing to get involved in any violent incidents that occur.

Allegedly run by businessman, Jimmy Pegorino, this crime family is a new phenomenon.

That mommy is on Ampheterate since starting therapy years ago? That daddy has to take a Mollis in order to bypass his biological response to throw up on my saggy tits? That we sneak gin martinis at lunch? What? These players deserve to be fired.

He is investigating top brass in the LCPD with a view to rooting out all that is wrong with that sinister conservative institution. We asked Mr. Goldberg what he thought was the next step for him after the city government has taken notice of his complaints, "Well, it's a big job I've got at hand. The LCPD has been corrupt for years and there are a lot of people in it who need to pay for their actions.

If you can sue a tobacco company for giving you lung cancer, why can't you sue an oil company for putting a hole in the ozone layer and giving you skin cancer? Or a car company for polluting the environment and screwing up your lungs. A professional skier would have good cause to sue someone for causing global warming and stopping it snowing.

No doubt all the right-wing, white-trash hillbillies who read Weazel News will lap up this capitalist propaganda. Eris is the embodiment of everything that is wrong with American greed and the relentless march towards globalization.

It comes as no shock that Wolfe would jump at the chance to become Julius Caesar: the two of them are vying for the top spot in the competition for the biggest egomaniac in history. Wolfe is now under investigation following reports that he publicly endorsed the scheme in a desperate attempt to speed up online subscriptions.

The Eunux community has taken the girl's attempts to infiltrate their little white boys' club as a personal attack on their inadequate masculinity and has thrown all their joint efforts into publicly bashing her on blogs and newsgroups.

Brilliant economist and Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Darius Wolfe, has revealed that he was persuaded into investing $20,000 into a online pyramid scheme. "As soon as I received the spam email titled 'Amazing Business Opportunity' that directed me to <a href="www.money2makemoney.com">www.money2makemoney.com</a>, I just had to know more," said Wolfe, "I've never been able to resist a risky investment."

Pireni spent 20 minutes on the first slide, using a laser pointer to underline bulletpoints that said: <br/> * Protect <br/> * Serve <br/> * Freedom <br/> He then played the Star-Spangled Banner on an acoustic guitar and ended with a chorus of reporters singing "What does freedom mean to me?" that drew tears from the audience.

While activists and other un-Americans have questioned the war on terror, to those who have died at the hands of police during protests, it is quite clear. "These terrorists want to take away our freedoms. But look, we've done it for them. Ha. We win. You lose. Eat my shit terrorists. Yeah, you like that? Do you?

It's a natural consequence of years of over-regulation, big government and the killing of the entrepreneurial spirit that made this country the envy of foreigners everywhere. The country will enter a serious recession and be governed by a combination of Islamic terrorists, homosexuals and communists unless action is taken immediately - the government must cut the highest rate of income tax for the rich, abolish capital gains tax and liberate the rich to make investments wherever they see fit.

Family values will be mandatory under the new law, and sodomy has been outlawed completely except in rare cases. Citizens are required to submit their email passwords to their local police to assist in tracking down those who would do harm to our country.

Our enemies don't hate us because we bomb them or protect vicious absolute monarchies in oil rich states - that's left wing poppy cock. Our enemies hate us because we tolerate degenerates.
