	0x2DF8B3E9 = Party For Two
	0x5EF35332 = Tony Queen and his rent boy princess, Luis Lopez, are at it again. Apart from being the least convincing non-couple since two men spit-roasted an albino cheetah in Las Venturas, Queeny and Queenier insist on telling half the few desperate shlobs who bother to try to go to the now irrelevant Maisonette to take a hike. Get over yourselves! Hello sweeties, no one is interested in coming in there to watch you lap dance each other anyway.
	0x6E9D5F25 = Teen Blues
	0x7CB7ADC1 = Tourists in Star Junction got a surprise earlier when they looked up to see aging action star Chris Hunt's flaccid member flashing across the Weazel News Mega-Screen. Our sources hear that an explicit video featuring him and British debutante Daisy Cash-Cooze was broadcast to passers-by before being leaked on the internet. It was like briefly time travelling back to the nineties when people actually went to see Chris Hunt movies. They're about as old as the dinosaurs, people. That oh so familiar sense of disappointment came back too, when we realised that the only thing you get to see is a hand job! Boo! I watch hand shandies every morning in my shower! Come on Chris, you're going to have to do better than that if you expect any of us to believe that you stand to attention for anyone other than your little Filipino house boy! P-lease!
	0x7FBB2AD0 = Queen's Crown Slipping
	0x8A478F77 = Hey Mr. Celebinator, we're big fans of your site at the club, so it's kind of confusing when we read this spiteful shit. I'm sure you don't wanna offend us, so give us a call and we'll try to work it out.
	0x22FDB70C = In other Maisonette 9 news, Poppy Mitchell was thought to be engaged in group sex in the VIP room! Poppy Mitchell! And we thought she was a nice girl? We wish we'd been there to see it / film it / join in / all of the above. Sadly we weren't and the paps were too soggy to get some good photo journalism for us. :( Anyway, we love your newest RomCom Poppy, we don't care if you're a cum guzzling slut queen.) xxx
	0x34BBDA88 = Some paparazzi got a nasty surprise outside Maisonette 9 the other night as a rogue fire truck accidentally sprayed them with their hose. I know some people who'd kill to have a fireman turn his hose on them, but these paps aren't so happy. Several of them are getting together to launch a class action suit against the LCFD. Keeping the paps' cameras working is a hell of a lot more important that the firemen's pension plans so I say go for it. Who ever saw an old fireman anyway?
	0x36B130E8 = The Party Continues
	0x80D7EDDD = Want to know the real reason Vinewood leading man Bruce Spade fired his agent? He couldn't book him a gig at the Civilisation Committee. A source close to El Spado says "Bruce has been reading a lot of pamphlets on international relations recently. He's got some really interesting theories he wants to share with luminaries from around the world and thought addressing the Citadel was the perfect way to do it." When his agent couldn't secure the appointment (normally reserved for world leaders) he threw a hissy fit and tore up their contract. Hopefully his next agent will be able to help him get that Peace Prize he's been eying for the awards cabinet.
	0x112E8A2D = Al Di Napoli - star of stage, screen, and drugs interventions around the country - has raised fresh doubts about his ability to perform on the Boulevard stage every night. We're not talking about the garbled lines or the stink of booze that goes all the way back to row F at the AmDram Theatre. No, police are wanting to question him after a Celebinator-reading cop recognised him as one of the suspects in a drugs bust. Big Al claims that he was in his hotel room all night and has several hookers to back up this story, but is still considered a suspect. Whoever's insuring Al's production of Legless better watch out. It's only a matter of time...
	0x173A0BE0 = FYI - I'm not writing this as the Celebinator, but a mere human being. I?ve got all this power and it should be wielded with responsibility. With that in mind, Gay Tony Prince is the first / only guy we're apologizing to. We got to know him and his charming partner, Luis Lopez, when we shared a bottle of vintage Bleutr'd on a helicopter tour of the city. We talked about summer parties in the Carraways and winters in Vice - we clicked. That stuff we said before was stupid. Maisonette and Hercules are still the two hottest clubs in the town, and the guys who run it are awesome!
	0x179EE7E7 = Whoop! Whoop! After a brief closure by the city on health and safety grounds - boring people - Tony Queen's two nightclubs have reopened. Yay! EVERYONE is going to be at the opening gala including moi! It's going to be proper fabulous! I'd write about it for you, but I'll probably be too gone on Bleutr'd too type, and too surrounded by fabulous people to be able to single one out. Jealous much??? Welcome back, Tony. Kiss kiss. I love you!
	0x394C5CE9 = Tiny tweeny pop sensations the the Brothers Blue set mouths wagging after a fan accused them of date rape. No one has been able to get the truth since their meany publicist told them to keep schtum. Well, one of our spies managed to corner Bill and Bobby at a party and we've got the low down! You heard it here first, the kind souls only gave her a sedative to calm her down. "She was freaking out having a panic attack so we slipped her one to chill her out. We thought she might die." Good thing you had those roofies on you boys, you can sedate us whenever you like!
	0x417E2DAC = It's a Rap for Clay
	0x96626E7C = Prince Back on his Throne
	0x698395CE = Clay 'The Pain Giver' Jackson was spotted out with a mystery blond last night. No, not Poppy Mitchell or Cloe Parker. Contrary to what Mr. Jackson would have us believe in his raps, this date was less ho and more homo. His new album of ballads LOVE ISN'T A CRIME comes out soon. Being gay isn't a crime either, Clay, so get on out of that closet, amigo! And stop going to Hercules! Closet case or not, that place SUCK, SUCK, SUCKS!
	0x83956705 = Rumor has it a member of the British Royal family has been taking time out from spending taxpayer money in the UK to come spend their money over here. After a few too many at a Middle Park East drinks party he over-shared with one of our secret informants - "I've had all the 18 to 25 year olds in London so I'm going to come over here until a new crop matures. Being next in line to the throne might allow you to quash tabloid kiss and tell stories, but not so much with the statutory rape allegations." Awww. It's a hard life, isn't it, petal?
	0xB45D9D6F = Poppies, Pappies, and a wild night at Maisonette
	0xBFEB4F91 = Once legendary night club Mr. Big, Gay Tony is losing his touch. Rumors persist he's too wrapped up in his rent boy, Luis Lopez, to worry about running a decent club any more. Tony, who was a big star before the internet but has seen his popularity begin to wane, really should try relaxing his notoriously strict door policy and letting people in. Now it seems Tony and Luis are too busy staring into each other's eyes to worry about the fact their drinks are overpriced, their music is lame and even worse, the cool people simply don't go to their shitty clubs anymore. Bye bye!
	0xD8CABB5B = Yummy but ohh so skinny Brit, Charlotte Crown is fighting back against people who say she is anorexic. We saw her out last night and she said "I just love food. I am obsessed by food. Seriously. When I get older and have kids, I'm definitely going to write a cook book. All my favorite recipes. I love eating. I ate 3 shepherd's pies today and lots of crisps and fish and chips and all these scrummy English things, because I'm really proud of being English, even though I have to live in Los Santos now. I'm definitely not anorexic. It's ridiculous. I'm just really lucky." You go girl! And don't forget to start shaving soon. Ciao!
	0xD729A905 = Regal Airs
	0xE1301FD5 = (note: I would never compromise this blog's credibility by accepting bribes. Tony, Luis and me really did vibe, and the clubs are f-ing fabulous. You'd be a doofus to think otherwise!

	0xE3103446 = The Hunt is On
	0xF06F6AEF = Ace of Spades
	0xFE429417 = The other day I had the unfortunate experience of getting up-close and personal with the statue of Happiness. It's horrible! I could swear that disgusting strained smile on her face reminds me of someone, too. That's the face of a woman who needs some work done, or some action, or both! I mean, she is seriously living a lie, that one, and for what? She just stands there and does nothing! Reminds me of my mother. If I was married to that cold slab of stone I'd be off with any fat bird who'd take me. It's amazing that angry black heart of hers still beats in her chest.

In one of the most daring steals of the last few months, a band of pirates have stolen a subway car in Broker. Bystanders report a "dusky" looking man climbing along the roof of the train and unhooking it before it was pulled into the air by a Skylift.

In light of the recent attacks, many say they'd rather take their chances than deal with the congestion, inconvenience and loss of liberty that comes with a so-called safer community.

The suspect has been identified as Michael Keane, a convicted felon from Dukes. Four men wearing suits and balaclavas entered the branch and held the customers hostage while blowing the door to the vault with explosives. In the confusion, brave customer Eugene Reaper attempted to stop the robbery and was murdered in cold blood. Three robbers left the bank on foot and fought their way through police before escaping on the subway. Authorities are questioning all known associates of Mr. Keane in an attempt to discover the identities of his accomplices.

Recent weeks have seen several incidents, raging from stoned people fighting while standing in line for munchies to major shoot outs between gangs during drug deals. City officials denied clams they were useless free loaders and promised that things would change. With the city now solely focused on house prices and coffee shops, a reversion to a high crime rate would be bad for everybody, and maybe force some of us to move back to the suburbs.
	0xE8B03A1D = Despite the President's speech last week that the recession is over, speak to anyone on the street and they will tell you times are tough. Bagels now cost a fortune.

The Rampage are now likely to be the subject of a series of court cases as Mr. Ashvilli's complex business affairs are untangled by the state.

Men won't bring women to a war or robot movie, but women will drag their men to a romantic comedy.

The One-Eyed Sailor, a neighborhood dive bar for over 50 years, has been overrun with hipsters in recent months following a blog post that described it as, "undiscovered, counter-cultural and uber-raw." Jude Corbin, age 32, had been running up a tab on his parents' credit card with six or seven other identically-dressed, bearded 20-somethings since the early afternoon. The group spent a few hours loudly debating the type of bagel that best defines their identity, while slouching outside every five minutes to nonchalantly smoke clove cigarettes. As they became increasingly drunk, however, tensions with the regular customers began to build. When they started playing 80s music on the juke box and ironically body-popping, their patronizing fauxhemian antics proved too much for one local man, who dragged Corbin outside by his asymmetrical bangs and proceeded to beat him on the sidewalk, shouting, "Go back home you ridiculous hipster scum,". Corbin's friends ran off immediately, leaving the 90-pound, wannabe Beat Poet at the mercy of his 250-pound assailant.

Mr. Kapowitz plans to take his newfound wealth down to Vice City where he will start a gun shop and liquor store, "They're real men down there and they need real guns and liquor in one convenient location."

Mr. Gravelli has been head of the Gambetti crime syndicate since 1978 and under his stewardship, the family had become the most powerful of Liberty City's crime families, rivaling the Pavano family. Although he had been indicted several times, Mr. Gravelli was never convicted of a serious crime. Some believed he had contacts within the government who protected him, and for whom he would get criminal associates to perform hits and other crimes, but these allegations were never substantiated. What happens now to the delicate balance of power amongst criminal gangs within Liberty City is unknown. It is unlikely to be pretty.

After collapsing on the job in what she describes as a work/life balance, McColland is fighting for all Liberty City businesses to allow 2 months paid vacation a year, flexible hours, yoga a flotation/isolation chamber spa on site.
